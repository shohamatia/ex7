- Given a pattern P of length m and a text string S of length n, the time complexity of the naive search
algorithm is going throw all the substrings of length m meaning (if P is from the same characters of S or if
is the same but the last one, in that case we will run n-m+1 times on the string for m times, O(m*(n-m+1)).

====================
=   pseudo-code:   =
====================
NaiveSearch(pat, txt):
    m = pat.len
    n = tat.len
    for i in range{0, n-m+1}:
        j=0
        for j in range{0 , m}:
            if txt[i+j] is not equal to pat[j]:
                brake
        if j == m - 1:
            return i

- Implementation of metadata:
    we give the information about the characters in the scene, the scene name and number, the credits of this
    episode/ movie and the file it was found in.
    we store the metadata in Linked List and add to it when we create the blocks in the parseFile method.
